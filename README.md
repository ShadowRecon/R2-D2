Project: R2-D2

Description: This project is based upon the R2-D2 movie prop from the Star Wars movies. This projects goal is to 
  build a platform to design and develope a robotic AI system without the worry of dealing with low level functions.
  The IRobot Roomba 400 series vaccumm is used as the base. From the base up will be a custom designed shelving system
  that allows for vital systems to be protected from damage and provides more space to design which means more space 
  for sensors and other important functions. The height of the platform is yet to be determined. The system is 
  completely modular and allows for easy expansion.
